# GPT-Translate for Laravel

`gpt-translate` is a package for Laravel that allows you to generate a translation file based on translation strings found throughout your application. You can call these strings using `__()`, `@lang()`, `$t()`, or `trans()`, and they can be located in php, js, ts, tsx, or vue files.

Furthermore, `gpt-translate` enables you to translate your base language file, whether you previously had it or generated it using the package, to other languages using the ChatGPT API. Supported languages for translation include English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finish, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese.

## Laravel Version Compatibility

This package supports multiple Laravel versions:
- **Laravel 10.x** (PHP ^8.2)
- **Laravel 11.x** (PHP ^8.2)  
- **Laravel 12.x** (PHP ^8.2)

The package automatically adapts to your Laravel version and provides full compatibility across all supported versions.

## Getting Started

**Installation**  
    Add the following to your `composer.json` file:
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        "gpt-translate": {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/techlove/gpt-translate.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

   Then install the package using composer:
```bash
composer require techlove/gpt-translate
```

**Service Provider Auto-Discovery**
Laravel 5.5+ supports package auto-discovery. The service provider will be automatically registered. 

For older versions of Laravel, manually add the service provider to your `config/app.php` file:
```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Techlove\GptTranslate\TranslateProvider::class,
    ...
],
```


**Publish the Configuration File**  
You need to publish the `openai.php` configuration file:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

**Environment Configuration**  
Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` variables to your `.env` file with the details from your OpenAI account.

**Fetch All Translatable and Translate**
As shown, this command extracts all translatable strings into a `lang/en.json`, then translate them using ChatGPT into a new file `lang/sv.json`.
These values are used as default and can therefor be left out of the command:
```bash
php aritsan translate:extract --origin=en --lang=sv --model=gpt-3.5-turbo --path=resources/lang
```

**Generate Base Translation File**  
If you don’t already have a base translation file, generate it using:
```bash
php artisan translate:make --lang=en --path=resources/lang
```
As shown, this command creates a `lang/en.json` in your root folder. If your application is in another language, pass the appropriate `lang` parameter, e.g., for Swedish:
```bash
php artisan translate:make --lang=sv --path=resources/lang
```


**Translate with ChatGPT**  
After having your base translation file, whether generated by the package or otherwise, run the translation command for ChatGPT to do the translation, e.g.:
```bash
php artisan translate:lang --origin=en --lang=sv --path=resources/lang
```
This translates the original `en.json` to Swedish and creates a new `sv.json` file.

**Provide Context (Optional)**  
For more accurate translations, briefly describe the context of your application’s purpose. This helps ChatGPT better understand and translate the text. Use the `context` parameter:
```bash
php artisan translate:lang --origin=en --lang=sv --context="a pet product sales application" --path=resources/lang
```


**Specify the Model (Optional)**  
By default, the package uses GPT-3.5. If desired, specify any other OpenAI model compatible with the Chat API:
```bash
php artisan translate:lang --origin=en --lang=sv --model=gpt-4 --path=resources/lang
```
